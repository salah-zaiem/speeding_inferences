What to do to run the early exit:

*Put the 'ee_wavlm' folder in the 'transformers/models/' directory of your conda environment. There may be some things to add in the 'init' files to add pointers to these things, you will know if there are errors.

The directory from which you load 'wavlm_large' should be called 'eewavlm'.
